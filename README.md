# FacialGenderRecognition
A small dataset with smiling/serious faces of men and women is used for training and testing the classifier.
A feature matrix X and label matrix Y are created and based on them prior probability of a class and the likelihood are computed.
Using prior and likelihood, based on Bayes formula the system classifies a picture it has never seen.
